# Vim Config

This is a collection of settings that I am currently using in my vim setup. 
Right now this vim is much more geared towards javascript development. In the
future I will most likely add some python specific settings.

## Install 

1. Install this .vimrc \(*This assumes that you currently have no `~/.vim` folder*\)
2. Install Vundle
  `git clone https://github.com/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim`
3. Install Plugins. Just launch vim and type in `:PluginInstall` and then your done!
