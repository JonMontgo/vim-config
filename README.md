# Vim Config

This is a collection of settings that I am currently using in my vim setup. 
Right now this vim is much more geared towards javascript and python
 development. 

## Install 

1. Install this in .vim \(*This assumes that you currently have no `~/.vim` folder*\)
  `git clone https://github.com/JonMontgo/vim-config.git ~/.vim && ln -s ~/.vim/.vimrc ~/.vimrc`
2. Install Vundle
  `git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim`
3. Install Plugins. Just launch vim and type in `:PluginInstall` 
4. Configure [YCM](https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe) for python and javascript
